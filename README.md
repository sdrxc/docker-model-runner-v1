# ðŸš€ Running SmolLM2 with Docker Model Runner

This project demonstrates how to run the **SmolLM2** model locally using **Docker Model Runner** and interact with it in two different ways:

1. **Using Python `requests`** (direct REST API calls to `/engines/...`) :: In order to run the basic python code use, uv run main.py
2. **Using the `openai` Python SDK** (OpenAI-compatible API mode under `/v1/...`) :: In order to run the openai wrapper use, uv run openai_version.py
